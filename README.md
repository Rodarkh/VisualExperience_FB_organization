In this repository we have the Matlab functions necessary to run the model developed for this work, presented in Figure 5. 
Download all functions to a "VisualExperience_FB_organization-main" directory, and all data structures from the zip file to a "RFshape_parameter" directory inside "VisualExperience_FB_organization-main".
Changing Matlab to directory where functions are will allow to run Master_Script.mat and generate Figures 5 and 6 (takes several hours).


Contents:
Master_Script - this script will run the model with the conditions used to generate Figures 5 and 6. 

Model_RFoverlap - function that runs a single iteration of the model for the conditions specified in its inputs. 
It will get the parameters of the specified groups from the folder RFshape_parameters.

generate_Figure_5 - generates pannels C - J of Figure 5, using model data created by running Model_RFoverlap.

Model_RFoverlap_AspectRatio_mod - function that runs a single iteration of the model for the conditions specified in its inputs. 
It allows to change the aspect ratio of the Receptive Fields to study its effect. 

generate_Figure_6A -  generates pannels A of Figure 6, using model data created by running Model_RFoverlap_AspectRatio_mod.
