This repository contains the main dataset used in this paper. 

Each data structure contains data for more than one group:

DRP0_DRP21_NR_dataset.mat - 3 wild type animal groups with different visual experiences;
L23_DRP21_NR_dataset.mat  - 2 cux2 (feedback originating from LM L2/3) animal groups with different visual experiences;
L5_DRP21_NR_dataset.mat   - 2 Rbp4 (feedback originating from LM L5) animal groups with different visual experiences;

Most variables are organized as cells, with the first dimension of the cell representing the visual experience, the different groups. 
Each structure has variables with the same names. 
Unless stated in the variable name (by including "V1"/"N"/"neur"), each will have data per BOUTON or per ANIMAL. 
Here we detail the contents of these data structures:

currGroups = name of the groups of current structure. Identifies order of groups inside variables.
boot_RF_CI_xy = Receptive Field 95% Confidence Interval distance in x and y coordinates
boot_RF_CI_amp = Receptive Field 95% Confidence Interval amplitude (euclidean distance)
meanN = mean V1 neurons Receptive Field center per imaging session
neuronFitData = matrix with data per neuron. Includes the 9 parameters resulting from the 2D gaussian fit to estimate the receptive field. (offset , amplitude, xCenter, yCenter, RotationAngle, xAxis, yAxis, sum of squares, Rsquare)
nSess = ID number of session, resets for each animal
nSession = total number of session per animal
nTotalROIs_ani = total number of boutons per animal before calculating Receptive Field
real_animalID = animal ID number per bouton
real_animalID_neur_all = animal ID number per neuron (all neuron ROIs, regardless of Receptive Field quality)
real_boutonFitResults_all = matrix with data for all bouton ROIs. Includes the 9 parameters resulting from the 2D gaussian fit to estimate the receptive field. (offset , amplitude, xCenter, yCenter, RotationAngle, xAxis, yAxis, sum of squares, Rsquare)
real_dRF = individual Receptive Field center per bouton minus mean Receptive Field center for neurons of same session (aximuth and elevation coordinates)
